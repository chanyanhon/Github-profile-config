- 👋 Hello, I'm Milton Chan, a Data Scientist based in Hong Kong. I hold a degree in Statistics from The University of Hong Kong, which has provided me with a solid foundation in mathematical and statistical principles, contributing significantly to my career in machine learning and data science.

- My professional focus encompasses various aspects of (AWS) Cloud machine learning, including
- - data architecture design (datalake / lakehouse storage and compute),
  - resource management (workflow orchestration with AWS step function),
  - ML platform administration (utilizing & monitoring SageMaker for ML pipeline processing & prediction), and
  - establishing development environments with MLOps best practices (setting up CI/CD pipelines, managing Dockerfiles, and implementing Git version control)

👋 **Hello, I'm Milton Chan**, a **Data Scientist** based in **Hong Kong**.
